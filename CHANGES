Revision history for Grinder

0.5.3   30-May-2013
        Completed fix for bug #6, multiplexed read close to length of reference
           (reported by Ali May).
        When generating multiple libraries, default is now to use 100% permuted
           to have dissimilar communities (consistent with 0% shared as default).

0.5.2   26-Apr-2013
        Fixed bug causing reads too short when using MIDs and asking for a read
           length close to that of their reference (bug #6, reported by Ali May).

0.5.1   19-Apr-2013
        Fixed bug preventing the insertion of very low frequency sequencing
           errors (bug #5).
        Updated average_genome_size script to use percentage in Grinder rank
           file instead of fractional numbers.

0.5.0   14-Jan-2013
        Removed the =encoding statement which was breaking Pod::PlainText
           (reported by Lauren Bragg)
        Precompile <exclude_chars> regular expression

0.4.9   20-Nov-2012
        Significant speedup by using improved version of Bioperl modules
          (reported by Ben Woodcroft).
        Fixed bug in RF and FR -oriented mates produced from the reverse-
          complement of the reference sequence (reported by Mike Imelfort).
        Mate orientation documented for IonTorrent (reported by Mike Imelfort).
        The relative abundances reported by Grinder in the rank file are now
          expressed as percentage instead of fractional for consistency.
        Updated dependencies to satisfy older Perl (reported by Stephen Turner).
        Build the documentation on author-side, not user side (reported by
          Stephen Turner).

0.4.8   10-Oct-2012
        Fixed bug when making amplicon reads using specified relative abundances
          based on genomes with multiple amplicons (reported by Bertrand Bonnaud).
        Usage message improvements (reported by Xiao Yang).
        Delegated some operations to dedicated modules.

0.4.7   27-May-2012
        Requiring Math::Random::MT version 1.14 should fix issues that Windows
          users are having (reported by David Koslicki).

0.4.6   27-May-2012
        When generating kmer-based chimeras, save resources by only calculating
          the kmers of the reference sequences that are going to be used
          (improvement suggested by David Koslicki).
        Fixed an "undefined value" error when using kmer-based chimeras
          (reported by David Koslicki).
        Fixed an error when using kmer-based chimeras but not using all the
          reference sequences (reported by David Koslicki).

0.4.5   27-Jan-2012   
        Fixed bug when adding mutations linearly to a 1 bp read (reported by
          Robert Schmieder).
        Better handling of 0 bp reference sequences.
        Fixed bug when looking for amplicons on the reverse complement of a
          reference sequence.
        Properly remove the shortest of two amplicons, even if they are on
          different strands.

        Dependencies update: no need for Math::Random::MT::Perl anymore.

0.4.3   18-Jan-2012
        Implemented multimeras, i.e. chimeras from more than two reference
          sequences (suggested by anonymous reviewer). See <chimera_dist>.
        Implemented chimeras where the breakpoints correspond to k-mers shared
          by the reference sequences (suggested by anonymous reviewer). See
          <chimera_kmer>.

0.4.2   15-Dec-2011
        Fixed incorrectly calculated relative abundances when using length bias
          (reported by Mike Imelfort and Mohamed Fauzi Haroon).

0.4.1   25-Nov-2011
        The keyword 'strand' is not used anymore in the description of reads.
        Read coordinates are now reported like in the Genbank format:
          "position=complement(1..20)" instead of "position=1-20 strand=-1"
        Fixed bug reported by Dana Willner: when looking for full-length amplicon
          matches based on PCR primers, matches are now sought in the reference
          sequences but also in their reverse-complement
        Better handling of discrepancies between the number of libraries specified
          with the num_libraries option and in the abundance_file (reported by
          Dana Willner).

0.4.0   04-Nov-2011

          metagenomic, transcriptomic, metatranscriptomic, proteomic and
          metaproteomic datasets
        New error model suitable to simulate Illumina reads: 4th degree polynome
        Change in error model (mutation_distribution) parameter:
          - general syntax is now model_name, model_parameters...
          - the first parameter for the linear model is now the error rate at the
            3' end of the reads, not the average error rate
        Speed improvement for position-specific error models
        Galaxy GUI fix so that the output is fastqsanger, not just fastq
        The reference_file parameter is now a required argument, so that running
          grinder without arguments displays the help (reported by Robert Schmieder)
        Fixed a bug that caused a crash when using an indel model and a homopolymer
          model simultaneously (reported by Robert Schmieder)

        Option mutation_ratio has changed so that it is possible to specify indels without substitutions
        Location of amplicon relative to the reference sequence is now recorded
          in the read description using the 'amplicon' field
        Better reporting of chimeras in read descriptions using a comma-separated
          list for the 'amplicon' and 'reference' field
        Redundant sequencing errors (multiple errors at the same position) are
          now tracked in read descriptions

        Library number in ID of first sequence in libraries with even number was
          wrong when mate pair was used
        Number of the pair in mate pair IDs was wrong
        Grinder development put under Git versioning control on SourceForge
        More unit tests

        New option to generate basic quality scores if desired (-qual_levels)

        New option to sequence from the reverse strand: see <unidirectional>
          (suggested by Barry Cayford).
        Output FASTA files now named *reads* instead of *shotgun* because
          libraries can be amplicon too.
        Output file names now use numbers padded with zeroes so that, e.g. if
          123 libraries were requested, their name is in 001, 002 ... 123.
        Output folder is now created automatically if it does not already exist.
        The next_read() method now returns only one read, even for mate pairs.
        Force the alphabet to DNA when reading the primer sequence file since
          degenerate primers can look like protein sequences.
        Fixed bug where Grinder sometimes created libraries even though there
          were not enough sequences to do it safely (reported by Dana Willner).
        When the number of reads to generate is smaller than the required
          diversity, the actual diversity reported reflects this now.
        Not reporting errors "Not enough sequences for chimera..." when there is
          less than 2 reads and chimera_perc is 0.
        Fixed bug in argument processing by Getopt::Euclid that affected
          repeated calls to the new() method.
        Fixed calculation of number of genomes shared. Clearly specified in the
          documentation that the percent shared is relative to the diversity of
          the least abundant library (reported by Dana Willner).
        Fixed calculation of the total library diversity.
        Many more Grinder test cases.

0.3.2   11-Feb-2011
        New feature to specify specific characters to delete (N, -, ...) (suggested by Mike Imelfort)
        New method to retrieve the seed number used for the computation: $factory->get_random_seed
        When excluding specific characters, an amplicon read is attempted only once now
        More robust parsing of abundance file
        It is now a fatal error if sequences requested in an abundance file are
          not found in the genome file
        Small optimizations

0.3.1   08-Feb-2011
        Support for making multiple libraries with different richness (diversity) values

        Speed improvements

0.2.0   22-Sep-2010
        New options available when generating multiple shotgun libraries. Alpha
        and beta diversity can be specified:
          * richness
          * percentage of genomes shared between libraries
          * percentage of the top genomes with a different abundance rank
        Revised way that mate pair reads are named. Example:
          >1000/1 seq3|31-60
          >1000/2 seq3|41-70
        Added utility to calculate average genome length from Grinder rank file

          cannot be divided by the number of independent libraries required
        Changed output sequence ID to a more consistent scheme

0.1.7   15-Feb-2010
